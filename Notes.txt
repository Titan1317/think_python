Programs:
• A program is a sequence of instructions that specify a computation.

• Programming is the process of breaking down a large, complex task 
	into smaller and smaller subtasks, until the subtasks are simple
	enough be performed with one of the following basic instructions;

	-Input:
		Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network or some other device.
	-Output:
		Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network etc.
	-Math:
		Perform basic basic mathematical operation like addition and multiplication.
	-Conditional execution:
		Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.
	-Repition:
		Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

• A value is one of the basic things a program works with like a letter or a number.

• Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.

• Syntax rules in formal languages are strict and govern the structure of statements.
	They come in two flavors:
		-Tokens:
			-3 += 3$6
			$ is not a legal token in math
		-Combination of tokens:
			-3 += 3
			+= is not a legal combination of tokens in math 

• Variables are names that refer to ojects.

• Referencing is the association between a variable and its value.

• An object is something a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value.

• Aliasing is a circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object.
	(a is b) == True

• Assignments are names that refer to a value.

• An expression is a combination of vlaues, variables and operators.

• The interpreter evaluates expressions and executes statements.

• A statement is a unit of code that has an ffect like creating a variable or displaying a value. Statements generally don't have values.

• A traceback tells you what program file the error was in, what line and what functions were executing at that time.
	The order of the functions in traceback is the same as the stack diagram.


PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT:

• Guarding is a programming pattern that uses conditional statements to check for and handle
	circumstances that might cause an error.

• Scaffolding is code that is used during program development but is not part of the final version.

• A development plan is a process for writing programs. One process is is “encapsulation and generalization”. The steps of this process are:

	1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.

	2. Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it, encapsulate
		the piece in a function and give it a name.

	3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.

	4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working
		code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).

	5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if
		you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into
		an appropriately general function.

• The key aspects of the 'incremental development' process are:
	1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point,
		if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.

	2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.

	3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding
		or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does
		not make the program difficult to read.


DEBUGGING:

• Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for
	debugging. If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:

		• There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition
			is violated.

		• There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.

		• There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.

• Global variables can be useful, but if you have a lot of them, and you modify them
	frequently, they can make programs hard to debug.

• As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and
	checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:

	- Scale down the input:
		If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text
		file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find.
		You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it
		reads only the first n lines.
		If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error,
		and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.
	
	- Check summaries and types:
		Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries
		of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list
		of numbers.
		A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For
		debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.

	- Write self-checks:
		Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if
		you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the
		result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest.
		This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.
		Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see
		if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.

	- Format the output:
		Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an
		example in “Debugging” on page 70. The pprint module provides a pprint function
		that displays built-in types in a more human-readable format (pprint stands
		for “pretty print”).
		Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend
		debugging.

• Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend
	debugging.

STRINGS:

• A sequence is an ordered collection of values where each value is identified by an integer
	index.

• An index is an integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a
	string. In Python indices start from 0.

• An item is one of the values in a sequence.

• A slice is a part of a string specified by a range of indices.

• Traversing is to iterate through the items in a sequence, performing a similar operation on each.

• Searching is a pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.

 
LISTS:

• The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters
	of a string—the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the
	index. Remember that the indices start at 0.


• List indices work the same way as string indices:
	- Any integer expression can be used as an index.
	- If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError.
	- If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.

• Operators:
    The in operator also works on lists.
    The slice operator also works on lists.
    The + operator concatenates list.
    The * operator repeats a list a given number of times.
    If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the del operator. del list[index]

• If you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices.

• Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations
	that modify lists.

• The append method adds a new element to the end of a list and returns None.
	- Extend takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements, leaves the list
		unmodified.
	- Sort arranges the elements of the list from low to high and return None.

• There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the
	element you want, you can use the pop method, which returns the element.
	- If you don’t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.
	- If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove,
		The return value from remove is None
	
• The list function breaks a string into individual letters and returns a list of all the
	letters. If you want to break a string into words, you can use the split method, an 
	optional argument called a delimiter specifies which characters to use as word boundaries.


• Reducing is a processing pattern that traverses a sequence and accumulates the elements into
	a single result.

• Mapping is a processing pattern that traverses a sequence and performs an operation on
	each element.

• Filtering is a processing pattern that traverses a list and selects the elements that satisfy
	some criterion.


DICTIONARIES:

• A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called keys, and a collection
	of values. Each key is associated with a single value.

• In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a mapping from keys to values, so
	you can also say that each key “maps to” a value.

• The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.

• The in operator works on dictionaries, too; it tells you whether something appears as
	a key in the dictionary.

• To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method
	values, which returns a collection of values, and then use the in operator.

• Dictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the key
	appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns
	the default value.

• Lookup: Looking up the value of a key is called lookup.

• The raise statement causes an exception. ex raise LookupError(error_messege)

• A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each frame to the 
	frames of the functions it calls.

• A previously computed value that is stored for later use is called a memo.

• Mutable global varaibles can be modified inside a function without  a declaration.
	To reassign the global variable inside a function, you need to declare it.
