This function prints the sum of all the integers from 1 to n, given an integer n.

1) The program does not terminate. It exits with a runtime error since the maximum recursion
	depth is reached.
2) """This function takes an integer 'n', that is greater than or equals to zero and
	returns the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to 'n'"""
